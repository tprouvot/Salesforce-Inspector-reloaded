# Donations

Thank you for using Salesforce Inspector Reloaded! üôè

This project is an open-source fork of the original [Salesforce Inspector](https://github.com/sorenkrabbe/Chrome-Salesforce-inspector) created by Soren Krabbe. While I, Thomas Prouvot, have been maintaining and expanding the **Reloaded** version, it's important to clarify that this extension is **not** an official Salesforce product.

For a long time, I was hesitant to accept donations, primarily because of the project's origins as a fork. However, after receiving numerous requests and after some discussions, I've decided to open the possibility for those who wish to contribute financially to the continued development of **Salesforce Inspector Reloaded**.

Please note that:

- Donations will go directly to support the development and maintenance of the **Reloaded** version by me, Thomas Prouvot, not to the original creator, Soren Krabbe.
- If you'd like to contribute to a specific feature or donate to a particular contributor, feel free to reach out to them directly to ensure they receive your support.

Once again, **thank you very much** for your support and for using the extension!

With appreciation,
**Thomas Prouvot**.
