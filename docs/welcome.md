## How to proceed if you already have 'Salesforce Inspector' legacy version?

First, thank you for migrating. I hope you will enjoy the new features and UI of this one!

I suggest you disable the legacy version so that you'll be able to [migrate your saved queries](https://dufoli.github.io/Salesforce-Inspector-reloaded/how-to/#migrate-saved-queries-from-legacy-extension-to-salesforce-inspector-reloaded) from the previous one.
Once migrated you can uninstall the legacy version, you should not need it anymore.
