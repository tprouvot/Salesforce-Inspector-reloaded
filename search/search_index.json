The tool is designed to help administrators and developers interact with Salesforce in the browser. It is after all a browser add-on. Enabling automation is a non-goal.</li> <li>User experience is important. Features should be intuitive and discoverable, but efficiency is more important than discoverability. More advanced features should be hidden, and primary features should be central. Performance is key.</li> <li>Automatically provide as much contextual information as possible, without overwhelming the user. Information that is presented automatically when needed is a lot more useful than information you need to explicitly request. For example, provide autocomplete for every input.</li> <li>Provide easy access to the raw Salesforce API. Enhance the interaction in a way that does not break the core use case, if our enhancements fails.
